## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project focuses on building a Leads Conversion Classification System for X Education, an online course provider. The goal is to develop a predictive model that determines whether a lead will convert based on various factors collected during the client inquiry phase. With a current conversion rate of 30%, the company aims to improve efficiency by prioritizing high-potential leads, targeting an 80%+ conversion rate. The dataset consists of 9,000+ records from past leads, with key features like Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, and Last Activity. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and business insights, providing actionable recommendations to enhance lead conversion.
